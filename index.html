                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p class="intro">Anime is a unique form of animation that originated in Japan and has since become a
                    global phenomenon. It encompasses a wide range of genres, from action and adventure to romance,
                    horror, and science fiction. Anime is known for its colorful artwork, fantastical themes, and
                    vibrant characters. It often features complex storylines and tackles diverse subject matters which
                    can appeal to various age groups. Unlike western cartoons, anime can be aimed at both children and
                    adults, with some series tackling mature themes. The artistry and depth of anime have led to its
                    increasing popularity worldwide. Whether it’s a light-hearted comedy or a thought-provoking drama,
                    there’s an anime out there for everyone.</p>
